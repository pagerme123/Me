        hi soo i have got some good news and some bad il start with the bad
        <br>
        mamacas fell last night and a peace of lego hit her on the verry end of her body (her taily bit)
        <br>
        looks like shes fine but shes a bit sore she is mooving around and eating and stuff so thats good i dont think she will die or anything 
        <br> 
        so thats good but sadly her eggs have gone dry two! times now and i no longer think they will hatch on the other hand ive been gaining some members in my discord server sadly
        <br>
        this odd guy joined and started geting weaird with me know im 15!! so i had to ban them but a few of my frends joined and we are having fun im stil geting used to bloging i do love posting its like a dieary but bette 
        <br>
        when i right the blog pages i use vscode and i use the copilot extention to help me with the spelling and some times it will right a whole sentance for me and i just have to edit it a bit and its not like it not what i was gona say it just guess what im gona say
        <br>
        that helps me A LOT with speed as well as spelling and grammer
        <br>
        lets get into some more news i know some of you are just hear for mamacas updates so lets talk about her
        <br>

        <br>
        mama cas has been trying some new foods she has ate some pepper but she didnt like it much so i just fall back to cucumber 
        <br>
        i have been thinking of getting her some frends like snails i know snails lay eggs on ther own i think its the same with slugs that means they are hermaphrodites yea pretty cool huh
