            <br>
            <p>
            i love this photo of her with her face in the Cucumber its so cute.
            <br>
            so over the past 3 days shes been eating a lot of red bellpeper and some cucumber the bellpepper made her poop red which was funny i hade to clean it of the top of her enclosure
            <br> 
            i need to get some spring tails for her so they eat her poop and keep her enclosure clean and healthy
            <br>
            ive been considering getting her a friend but i dont no if she will like it or not plus i no if i can take care of snails as well as her but if i do get her a friend i mite get her a new enclosure 
            <br>
            the thing is if i do get a biger enclosure it will be harder to find her 
            <br>
            now i love the fact she can just eat some of the plants in her enclosure and she dosnt need me to feed her dependently so if i had to leave unexpectedly she would be fine for a few days
            <br>
            i hung with my friend today we met at my place and did my make up for the first time verry fun i do love goth make up looks

            we got pepeperoni pizza i say we i got pizza and she got ... never mind i cant remember what she got ¦:<em>p</em>
            <br>
